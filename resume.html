			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>
			    I founded Zotech Software around March of 2005,
			    with the objective of developing and marketing
			    software as an Independent Software Vendor. 
			    The first product was a web based application 
			    to support Agile Software Development through 
			    process automation and tracking. The product 
			    failed to gain sufficient funding to reach market
			    and the intellectual property developed was
			    subsequently sold to a competing interest.
		    </p>
		    <p>
		        From there, I repurposed Zotech as a Consulting /
		        Research and Development practice, and have operated
		        it in that capacity since early 2007. I've worked on
		        a wide range of projects, both commissioned and 
		        speculative, a selection of which are highlighted 
		        below.
	        </p>

			<h2>Project Highlights</h2>
			<ul>
			    <li><strong>Project &#8216;Z&#8217;</strong>: 
			        As noted above,
			        Zotech's first product was an Agile Development
			        Process automation and tracking application. The
			        product was to be marketed initially as an online,
			        hosted solution. Users would be able to enter key
			        project data&mdash;feature descriptions, priorities
			        and estimates; task assignments and work logs; QA
			        feedback and customer responses; etc.&mdash;and would
			        track progress, providing reporting and visualization
			        on key metrics such as velocity and burn-down charts,
			        defect/feature ratios, and so forth. Similar products
			        currently on the market include offerings from 
			        VersionOne and AxoSoft, among others.
			        <br><em>Technologies Used:</em><span class="tu">
			        Java / Java Servlets / JavaServer Faces / Struts 2 /
			        Hibernate / Spring / Postgres / XML / HTML / CSS / JavaScript
			        </span></li>
			    <li><strong>xRest Web Application Middleware:</strong>
			        An Open Source project, 
			        <a href="http://www.github.com/laurie71/express-rest/">xRest</a>
			        is a middleware API for the
			        Express web framework. It supports implementing RESTful
			        HTTP service end-points through intelligent request
			        routing and HTTP content negotiation, allowing a single
			        'controller' component to serve full HTML responses
			        to browser and Ajax requests as well as JSON/JSONP, 
			        XML, plain-text and other formats suitable for
			        consumption as web services. The entire project is
			        written in server-side JavaScript running on 
			        <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/">Node</a>.

			    <li><strong>Custom Dojo Widget Library:</strong>
			        Before Dojo's UI framework was as mature as it is today,
			        I was contracted to develop a number of custom widgets,
			        as well as produce enhancements and bug fixes for existing
			        widgets in the Dojo Framework. Where possible, enhancements,
			        fixes and widgets were contributed back to the Dojo project;
			        the remaining widgets were published as an independent
			        Open Source project. Although I terminated my involvement 
			        with that project once the contract expired, it continued to
			        be developed and maintained by others until advances in the
			        core Dojo Framework made it increasingly obsolete. 
			        <br><em>Technologies Used:</em><span class="tu">
			        Dojo Framework / JavaScript / Ajax / HTML / CSS
			        </span></li>
		        <li><strong>Terrain Voxelization and Nav-Mesh Generator:</strong> 
		            Aimed at improving the spatial awareness of AI driven
		            game agents in Unity3D productions, this project 
		            analyzed terrain- and  scene-model data using a 3D 
		            rasterization process to decompose the scene into 
		            voxel data. A watershed algorithm then aggregated 
		            the voxel data to produce a connected mesh of navigable 
		            regions, with attached meta-data to support efficient A* 
		            and HPA* path finding. The work was largely based on 
		            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/recastnavigation/"
		            >Mikko Mononen's Recast Navigation</a> project,
		            implementing the same algorithms in C#, adapted to 
		            Unity's APIs.
